            <p>The design of any fire-protection system is an exact science that takes into account a building’s use, occupancy, footprint, and even its other installed systems.</p>
            <p>“Fire-protection systems are complicated and sophisticated, and are different for just about every building,” notes Jeffrey E. Harper, engineering manager and vice president at Rolf Jensen & Associates Inc. (The RJA Group), an organization of fire-protection and security consultants based in Chicago. Every well-designed system, whether it is being designed for a new building or being installed as part of a renovation or retrofit, must be developed with specific objectives in mind.</p>
            <p>Planning for fire protection involves an integrated approach in which system designers need to analyze building components as a total package. In most cases, the analysis needs to go beyond basic code compliance and the owner’s minimum legal responsibilities for providing protection.</p>
            <p>“You need to look beyond a systems standpoint and examine, as a whole, how all the components work together,” notes Bruce Fraser, director of industry relations at SimplexGrinnell, Westminster, MA.</p>
            <p>As Jeffrey L. Harrington, president and founder of Harrington Group Inc., a fire-protection engineering firm in Duluth, GA, notes, the design process should be a holistic one for both new construction and retrofits. Building ownership and management, architects, engineers, contractors, and consultants all need to be involved in the planning and design process, and fully understand the issues and concerns of all other parties.</p>
            <h3>Code Compliance</h3>
            <p>Code compliance is the first objective in any design. Codes are legal minimum requirements; you have to meet the minimum with any design.</p>
            <p>“Sometimes you wind up with less protection than you should have; other times you end up with more,” Harrington says. “Compliance with building codes is like bandwidth. It gives you a broad-brush range that has to be applied to every single building in the jurisdiction. Sometimes it hits the mark and provides cost effectiveness and protection; other times it might not hit the mark.”</p>            
            <img src="/assets/images/firesprinkler.jpg" style="width: 192px; height: 180px;">
            <p>The additional challenge is that fire codes can vary substantially across the country, even within a state or county. “Take Chicago, for instance,” notes Donald Goosman, construction manager at Rolf Jensen. “You might manage one building in the suburbs and one in the city. The fire code could be very different between those two buildings. Even minor differences can have major implications on system design.”</p>
            <p>Goosman and Harper say that when Rolf Jensen practitioners work with clients, they explain what the code requires, what they (as fire-protection engineers) recommend, and which options exist.</p>
            <p>New or retrofit, we suggest to the owners that they consider things [beyond] what the codes require,” Harper says. “We recommend going over and above if it ensures proper maintenance and enhanced life safety.”</p>
            <p>Well-versed architects and engineers, as well as manufacturers’ representatives, will be able to guide you in determining if your system, new or retrofitted, should meet minimum code or go beyond the essentials.</p>
            <h3>The Basics</h3>
            <p>In the design process, these typical fire-protection system goals are on the table for consideration:
                <ul>
                    <li>Saving lives.</li>
                    <li>Saving property.</li>
                    <li>Preserving business continuity.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
